# EmergingSysArch-Tech

## Summarize the project and what problem is was solving
The following projects have to do with embedded systems. The second milestone has to deal with interacting with the boards LEDs based upon input typed upon the keyboard. The third milestone has to deal with interacting with the buttons on the board and changing the LEDS in coordination with morse code.

## What did you do particularly well?
I believe that I didn't excel particularly well in these projects but I think overall this knowledge is invaluable and will benefit me in the future when thinking about programming systems.

## Where could you improve?
Improvment could be along the lines of understanding embedded systems more because the final project was quite difficult that worked with similar applications of these two milestones in addition to task scheduling and utilizing the temperature sensor upon the board.

## What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
Utilization of the board itself, the different drivers utilized like UART, i2C, interrupts among the few used. Along with the use of the IDE needed to program the board specifically.

## What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
I believe the most important skill that is transferable to other projects has to do with the ability to create state machines as this is a good way to guage and handle user input with a finite amount of input vectors.

## How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
This project was maintainable, readable, and adaptable by utilizing best practices, following requirments and keeping in mind to always think about future proofing and making sure that developers in the future can easily understand what has been written before them. I believe that being clear and consise is key to source understanding.
